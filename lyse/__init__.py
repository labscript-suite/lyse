    """Get data from the lyse dataframe or a file.
    
    This function allows for either extracting information from a run's hdf5
    file, or retrieving data from lyse's dataframe. If `filepath` is provided
    then data will be read from that file and returned as a pandas series. If
    `filepath` is not provided then the dataframe in lyse, or a portion of it,
    will be returned.
    
    Often only part of the lyse dataframe is needed, so the `n_sequences` and
    `filter_kwargs` arguments provide ways to restrict what parts of the lyse
    dataframe are returned. The dataframe can be quite large, so only requesting
    a small part of it can speed up the execution of `lyse.data()` noticeably.
    Setting `n_sequences` makes this function return only the rows of the lyse
    dataframe that correspond to the `n_sequences` most recent sequences, where
    one sequence corresponds to one call to engage in runmanager. Additionally,
    the `Dataframe.filter()` method can be called on the dataframe before it is
    transmitted, and the arguments specified in `filter_kwargs` are passed to
    that method.

    Args:
        filepath (str, optional): The path to a run's hdf5 file. If a value
            other than `None` is provided, then this function will return a
            pandas series containing data associated with the run. In particular
            it will contain the globals, singleshot results, multishot results,
            etc. that would appear in the run's row in the Lyse dataframe, but
            the values will be read from the file rather than extracted from the
            lyse dataframe. If `filepath` is `None`, then this function will
            instead return a section of the lyse dataframe. Note that if
            `filepath` is not None, then the other arguments will be ignored.
            Defaults to `None`.
        host (str, optional): The address of the computer running lyse. Defaults
            to `'localhost'`.
        port (int, optional): The port on which lyse is listening. Defaults to
            the entry for lyse's port in the labconfig, with a fallback value of
            42519 if the labconfig has no such entry.
        timeout (float, optional): The timeout, in seconds, for the
            communication with lyse. Defaults to 5.
        n_sequences (int, optional): The maximum number of sequences to include
            in the returned dataframe where one sequence corresponds to one call
            to engage in runmanager. The dataframe rows for the most recent
            `n_sequences` sequences are returned. If the dataframe contains
            fewer than `n_sequences` sequences, then all rows will be returned.
            If set to `None`, then all rows are returned. Defaults to `None`.
        filter_kwargs (dict, optional): A dictionary of keyword arguments to
            pass to the `Dataframe.filter()` method before the lyse dataframe is
            returned. For example to call `filter()` with `like='temperature'`,
            set `filter_kwargs` to `{'like':'temperature'}`. If set to `None`
            then `Dataframe.filter()` will not be called. See
            :meth:`pandas:pandas.DataFrame.filter` for more information.
            Defaults to `None`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `n_sequences` isn't `None` or a nonnegative integer, then
            a `ValueError` is raised. Note that no `ValueError` is raised if
            `n_sequences` is greater than the number of sequences available. In
            that case as all available sequences are returned, i.e. the entire
            lyse dataframe is returned.

    Returns:
        :obj:`pandas:pandas.DataFrame` or :obj:`pandas:pandas.Series`: If
        `filepath` is provided, then a pandas series with the data read from
        that file is returned. If `filepath` is omitted or set to `None` then
        the lyse dataframe, or a subset of it, is returned.

"""
This is a stand-alone script which copies an image to the clipboard and then
optionally deletes the image file.

usage:

    python tempfile2clipboard.py [--delete] image_filepath


After copying the image data to the clipboard, this script optionally deletes
the image file, if the --delete argument is provided, and then continues
running until the clipboard data changes.

This is due to the way in which some clipboards work - data is not requested
from the application until it is pasted somewhere, and so the application
doing the copying must still be running. It is also useful to have this
functionality be a stand-alone script since it requires a Qt mainloop, and
this way we avoid corner-cases of how this may interfere with any use of Qt in
the calling program.
